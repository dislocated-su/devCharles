                This week was all about team introduction. We had our first practical and we decided on 
                team name and team roles and set up the platforms like Github and Discord. 
                The team worked on preparing questions for upcoming client interview using the product brief.

                We had the client meeting on the Thursday (2023/11/24) of this week and it was followed by starting work on website 
                and other deliverables for the assessment like Requirements, Risk Management, 
                and Method Selection. This week we took our initial steps of development and set up libgdx.

                We continued working on the deliverables and this week we finally started development work. Implementation began on Sunday (2023/12/04), 
                the last day of the week. We set up the basic project structure and added some 
                assets to the repo on the same day. We finished work for some the deliverables. 
                These were, Requirements, Risk assessments and Method selection.

                This week our work was mainly on polishing up some of the deliverables and we continued implementation of the game, 
                albeit at a slower pace. 
                For the game, we worked on delivering the functionality of 
                switching between multiple cooks and cleaning up some of the work. 
                We also introduced several additional classes and created a way to change control of cooks and improved movement. 
                We worked on the physics of the game with metres.

                eeded to be worked on again. We worked on viewpoint in the game and some more physics like collisions.

                This was undoubtedly the busiest week of the project. 
                We created an emergency plan and distributed the unfinished work among team members.
                 We worked on the User Interface, food rendering, food cooking logic, light adjustments,
